# KVectors

The `KVectors` [Julia](http://julialang.org) package defines the `KVector` Type
to represent linear combinations of k-blades [k-blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_(geometry))

All Blades in a given KVector have the same grade.

This is the main object in [Grassmann Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra).

KVectors essentially extends the algebras and Types defined in [Blades](../Blades.jl) with the `+` operator.  This allows for a vector space of Blades.  

Most operators that act on Blades can act on KVectors.  Notable exceptions are the inner product `â‹…` and geometric product `*`.
These can not operate on KVectors as they can result in a mixed grade vector.  The KVectors algebra is not closed under such operators.  For mixed grades you need [Multivectors](../Multivectors.jl)

See the documentation of [Blades](../Blades.jl) for more information.
